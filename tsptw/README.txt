TSP with Time Windows
===================================

tsptw_cp.mzn      CP formulation (using the formulation from the CP
                  handbook with the giant tour representation and
                  the circuit constraint)

tsptw_yuck.mzn    Model for Yuck (using the delivery constraint)

Ascheuer          50 instances introduced by Ascheuer [1]
Dumas             135 instances proposed by Dumas et al. [2]
Gendreau          130 instances proposed by Gendreau et al. [3]

The instances were taken from [4]. See [5] for more information on them.
